Hello! As you have probably already gathered my name is **Max Kelly!** I am an aspiring Junior Web Developer looking to make some headway into the industry.

This page will serve three main purposes
1. It will be an ongoing project for me to manage, as my personal shopfront it is key that I maintain and update it with new technologies and ideas.
2. It will link anyone interested to other projects I am working on or have worked on in the past; projects that I feel deserve some attention or showcase effectively my abilities with code.
3. It will serve as a gateway for potential clients and employers to contact me for work! I will be adding my conact details to this page, and if you *are* a potential client or employer then I do very much hope to hear from you soon!
